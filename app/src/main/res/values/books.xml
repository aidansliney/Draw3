    <string-array name="b01t01Help">
        <item>Start by laying down the basic shape of the head</item>
        <item>Using the size of the head, we can lay out markers for proportions</item>
        <item></item>
        <item>Lay out the figure as simply as this. With circles as the joints and lines to indicate the limbs and torso</item>
        <item>Note the shoulders should be half a head down</item>
        <item>The Hands reach down at the bottom of the 4th head alongside the hips</item>
        <item>The legs reach down to 8 heads down. With these indicators, we can lay more solid down forms on top</item>
        <item>Two three dimensional shapes, the Top and bottom forms are cylinders, and the middle one is a sphere</item>
        <item>Draw in the larger top cylinder to represent the chest</item>
        <item>A sphere for the stomach, which can help us visualise how the torso can bend and rotate if we were twisting the body</item>
        <item>And the small cylinder for the waist</item>
        <item>These spheres will represent the ball and socket joints that our arms and legs rotate from. Namely the shoulder and the hips</item>
        <item>Some more three dimensional shapes we will use for the arms and the legs</item>
        <item>Start off the arms and legs with a long cylinder that reaches the ball we drew to mark the elbow</item>
        <item>Then use a tapered cylinder for the lower half of each limb</item>
        <item>The hands are covered in more detail in their own tutorial. Draw in the shapes for the legs, and connect the forms together</item>
        <item>Finally, draw in a cylinder to represent the neck</item>
        <item>Using the head tutorial, draw in where the facial features will go</item>
        <item>The chest line will go from the point where your arm meets the Shoulder, down to the line that is two heads down</item>
        <item>I like to connect the major cylinders together</item>
        <item>Great. That’s the hard work done, you have laid out the important forms. Go ahead and lightly erase those lines to draw your final figure over it.</item>
        <item>Use the head tutorial and draw in what is often the most important part of your figure</item>
        <item>Draw in the neck and whatever neckline you want depending on what clothes your figure is wearing</item>
        <item>Now outline the shoulder and arms. Note the trapezius muscle will make the line from his shoulder go up around his neck</item>
        <item>Most tops will go down the the belt line, which is at the top of your cylinder</item>
        <item>Then outline those chest muscles</item>
        <item>Use a lot of straight lines to draw in the legs. Most important is to outline the difference in shapes between the thighs and the calves</item>
        <item>Keep the foot nice and simple</item>
        <item>And there you have it.  You can fully erase the basic forms now to show off your character</item>
    </string-array>


    <string-array name="b01t02Help">
        <item>Let’s start with an oval shape to represent the head</item>
        <item>Draw two lines across to split it up into thirds</item>
        <item>Our drawing will be looking at the head at an angle. This line will be the centre line of our face</item>
        <item>Let’s take a look at this form represented by a 3D shape. This should help you visualise how the centre line rotates around the form as we look at it from a different angle</item>
        <item>Now, to help us lay out where the features go, let us add some more lines. Take the middle and bottom segment, and draw a line 1/3rd down in each segment</item>
        <item>We now know where to put the facial features. Let us add in ovals for the eyes along this line</item>
        <item>Draw a line from the centre of the eyes straight down the head. This will tell us exactly where to draw the mouth</item>
        <item>The top line is where we draw the eyebrows. You can draw the basics shapes of a rectangle joined to a triangle</item>
        <item>Where the centre line meets our third line, is where to put the nose. Remember, check the facial features book that outlines how to draw the nose</item>
        <item>The the mouth goes on the bottom line, and its width goes from the two centre lines drawn from our eyes</item>
        <item>We know where to put the ear thanks to the lines from our nose and eyes</item>
        <item>Let’s sharpen up the jaw line. Bring it to meet the chin, which is directly under the mouth, using the same lines from the eye</item>
        <item>Continue the jawline and chin line around to the other side of the face</item>
        <item>Add in the hair line</item>
        <item>And extent the back of the head. Our skull goes out slightly further than the initial oval shape we draw</item>
        <item>Great. That’s the hard work done, you have laid out the important forms. Go ahead and lightly erase those lines to draw your final figure over it</item>
        <item>Remember, the facial features are important, and we have a whole book dedicated to them.  Use it to learn how to draw them from each angle</item>
        <item>Everybodys features are different. Feel free to experiment with different facial shapes and sizes.</item>
        <item>Use the forms we laid out as guides where to draw in the detailed versions of each feature</item>
        <item>We look at the ear in the Features book too</item>
        <item>Now draw in the crown of the head, or use the outline to draw whatever hairstyle you like</item>
        <item>Draw in the jaw line, ignoring the curve of the initial oval</item>
        <item>Add in a few features. A line from the chin up towards the ear can indicate a strong jawline</item>
        <item>I like to indicate the bottom lip with a small line which helps tell us that the lip protrudes from the face. </item>
        <item>A small curve can show the “ala” area around the nostril</item>
        <item>And a curve here can help define the planes of the face.</item>
        <item>And there you have it.  You can fully erase the basic forms now</item>
        <item>Take a look at Level 2 of this figure to take your drawing up to the next stage. Or why not share your drawing with us.</item>

    <string-array name="b01t03Help">
        <item>Drawing the hands at an angle can be difficult. So always take a look at your own hands for reference. Draw in two rectangles as the palms of your hand </item>
        <item> Break the finger joints down into rectangles that extend from the top of your palm of your hand</item>
        <item> The tops of these rectangles curve down to indicate middle finger being the longest and the pinky being the smallest</item>
        <item>Your fingers have three joints and there for three bendable areas.  </item>
        <item>Extending from the palm, I like to draw a cylinder, almost representing the first bone of your thumb as a ball joint </item>
        <item>The second bone of the thumb extends from this like the fingers </item>
        <item>And the third follows. </item>
        <item>Break the rectangles used to outline the fingers into their own parts</item>
        <item>On the right hand here, the pinky is obscured by the ring finger</item>
        <item>Great. That’s the hard work done, you have laid out the important forms. Go ahead and lightly erase those lines to draw your final hand over it</item>
        <item>Each finger joins your sectioned off rectangles together.</item>
        <item>Remember, the middle finger is the longest</item>
        <item>The ring finger is slightly longer than the index finger</item>
        <item>The pinky is the smallest</item>
        <item>Lets draw the thumb, but note, we only indicate a small part of the ball joint, as the flesh surrounding it blends into the hand</item>
        <item>Same for the left hand. Draw the top two bones as normal, then a small bit of the ball joint as it blends into the hand.</item>
        <item>We can outline the hands going into the palms using the rectangle we drew in stage one</item>
        <item>Where the finger lines end, draw a small curve to indicate the knuckles where they should be seen</item>
        <item>And there you have it.  You can fully erase the basic forms now</item>

        <item>Start by laying down the basic shape of the head.</item>
        <item>Using the size of the head, we can lay out markers for proportions. .Our figure is 8 heads high.</item>
        <item>Lay out the figure as simply as this. With circles as the joints and lines to indicate the limbs and torso. Use the level 1 tutorial if you need help here.</item>
        <item>Now we can draw in the basic forms starting with the chest.</item>
        <item>Remember, each section is individually covered in more detail in this book.</item>
        <item>Always reference the grid of 8 heads to know where to line up the features. The belly button should be 3 heads down.</item>
        <item>The hips should be around 4 heads down. </item>
        <item>At this stage, the legs and the arms can be treated similarly.</item>
        <item>Use the tutorials for the hand and the foot when you are drawing them in.</item>
        <item>The bottom half of the leg and hand get thinner as they reach towards the wrist and foot.</item>
        <item>Outline the hands and the feet. Reference their individual tutorials. </item>
        <item>Lastly connect the head to the neck.</item>
        <item>That is the basic proportions mapped out. Lightly erase the lines and let us take the definition of the forms to the next level.</item>
        <item>Here is where the individual tutorials really come into play. Make sure you look at them.</item>
        <item>Continue refining the forms.</item>
        <item>Look at how the body parts interconnect. The chest muscle connects strongly to the shoulder, which the arm muscle emerges from.</item>
        <item>Similarly, the legs emerge from the hips.</item>
        <item>Draw in the feet.</item>
        <item>And the hands, referring the their tutorials.</item>

    <string-array name="b02t02Help">
        <item>Start with a simple spherical shape for the head.</item>
        <item>Take a look at this form represented by a 3D shape. This should help you visualise how the centre line rotates around the form as we look at it from a different angle.</item>
        <item>Draw in a horizontal and vertical line through the sphere. With the vertical one at an angle in the direction that the head will look towards.</item>
        <item>The head is not fully round, in fact it is important to create the planes of the face that are the side of the head and the front of the face. </item>
        <item>We can create those planes by taking a vertical slice off the sphere. </item>
        <item> From these three points we can draw in the bottom half of the face. </item>
        <item>Take the point where the jaw line meets the chopped sphere as a halfway marker from the spheres midline, in order to find out how far down the chin should go. </item>
        <item>Now we can clearly see the planes of the face.  </item>
        <item>Lightly erase some lines to give us a better view. </item>
        <item>Now draw a line horizontally half ways down our skull shape. This will be the eye line. Divide the front plane in half too.</item>
        <item> Draw some more horizontal lines down. One that is 1/3rd down from the eyes to the jaw. The other just slightly lower, marked by the bottom of our original sphere.</item>
        <item>Now, like in the level 1 tutorial, we can mark in where the facial features go.</item>
        <item>Remember, the facial features are covered in depth in their own book.</item>
        <item>The ear should go from the bottom of the nose, up to the eyebrows.</item>
        <item>Draw in your characters hairline, which can help define the planes of the face.</item>
        <item>Great. That is the hard work done, you have laid out the important forms. Go ahead and lightly erase those lines to draw your final head over it.</item>
        <item>I like to start with the eyes as they are often the first feature we look at. </item>
        <item>Add in the nose.</item>
        <item>The eyebrows.</item>
        <item>The mouth.</item>
        <item>And the ears.</item>
        <item>We can use our layout lines to draw the shape of the face. Depending on the the face you are drawing, you can add in a slight protrusion for the cheek bones.</item>
        <item>Follow the lines around and mark in the hairline to complete the basic head shape.</item>
        <item>And there you have it.  You can fully erase the basic forms now.</item>

    <string-array name="b02t03Help">
        <item>Start by laying out the lines that will represent the shoulders, and hips.</item>
        <item>The chest should stretch from shoulder to shoulder.</item>
        <item>The rib cage and the back is a large form that takes up most of the volume of the torso.</item>
        <item>The bottom half of the torso is shaped like a cylinder, down to the waist.</item>
        <item>The shoulders connect into the chest. They rise up higher following there the collarbone will go</item>
        <item>The neck then emerges from the chest, it will connected to the face by a group of muscles.</item>
        <item>The area that will be the abs comes down from the ribcage. It goes right down passed the waist towards the groin area.</item>
        <item>That is the basic proportions mapped out. Lightly erase the lines and so we can bring the definition of the forms to the next level.</item>
        <item>The pecs are two separate large muscles.</item>
        <item>Define the collarbone as it goes from the top of the chest over the shoulder.</item>
        <item>The shoulders will connect to the arms through the deltoid.</item>
        <item>Draw in the ribcage at the front and then the lats which wrap around from under the shoulder to the back.</item>
        <item>Now the abs. Note how one the belly button is in a gap between four abs.</item>
        <item>The oblique muscles emerge from the side of the abs at an angle up towards the lats.</item>
        <item>Draw in four small muscles which will connect the lats to the obliques. </item>
        <item>Then define the hips.</item>
        <item>Finally, the neck muscles. The most important two at the front, connect from the ears, down to the middle point of the collarbone.</item>

        <item>Similar to the level 1 tutorial, draw a tapered cylinder for bottom half of the arm as it thins as it goes down towards the wrist.</item>
        <item>That is the basic proportions mapped out. Lightly erase the lines and so we can bring the definition of the forms to the next level.</item>
        <item>First, let us draw in the shoulder. </item>
        <item>The main muscle of the arm comes out from below the lowest point of the deltoid. It stretches like this when the arm is flat</item>
        <item>The triceps wrap around the back of the arm, framing the shoulder. We can only see a small part of them from this angle.</item>
        <item>It is important to have a visual break in between where the lower half of the arm meets the top half.</item>
        <item>I will outline the hand here, but it has its own separate tutorial in this book.</item>
        <item>Great. That is the hard work done, you have laid out the important forms. Go ahead and lightly erase those lines to draw your final arm over it. Add in some extra details like the veins.</item>

        <item>From this angle, the sternocleidomastoid  and trapezius muscles slot right behind the clavicle.</item>
        <item>The deltoid is attached to the biceps, pulling on it if the arm is raised. The triceps emerge out of the back of the deltoid.</item>
        <item>The leg muscles come out from under the obliques and hip bone.</item>

        <item>Take a look at the individual tutorials which looks in detail at each section. The plains that the face makes really help define areas for adding in shading details.</item>
        <item>Again the neck muscles appear to slot right into the area behind the collarbone.</item>
        <item>The arms lock onto the shoulder.</item>
        <item>As the legs emerge from the hip bone.</item>
        <item>Remember to look at each individual tutorial.</item>

        <item>We will start with the basic forms that we sketched from the level 2 tutorial.</item>
        <item>The frontalis muscle defines the forehead.</item>
        <item>The orbital portion of the eye surrounds the eye lids.</item>
        <item>The cheekbones are an important defining feature. The temporalis muscle acts as one of the side planes of the top half of the face.</item>
        <item>The nasalis muscle is the bridge of the nose. The nose tip itself is broken into a few sections, one area for the centre point, the others to surround the nasal passages.</item>
        <item>Smiling involves lots of muscles. The outer portion of the mouth has lots of muscles connected into it. </item>
        <item>The mentalis muscle surrounded by the depressor labii inferioris creates a fleshy shape underneath and to the lower side of the mouth.</item>
        <item>Lastly draw in the ear.</item>
        <item>Great, now that we understand the muscles of the face a bit better, let us take a look at how they create plains on the face.</item>
        <item>The forehead areas is one of the largest. Make sure to define the front and side planes of the face and follow those down throughout the head.</item>
        <item>The brow creates a deep area for shadows. It cuts right back to behind the eye. </item>
        <item>The bridge of the nose is a flat area, then the nose tips itself creates a few important planes, often casting a shadow beneath it.</item>
        <item>A flat area runs from the nose down along the front plane of the face. </item>
        <item>The cheeks create an strongly defined area as the plane goes down to the chin.</item>
        <item>The side of the jaw can hollow under the line created by the cheekbones as it is a thin area which expands as the mouth opens. </item>
        <item>The chin is a simple shape. The more defined it is often leads to the stereotypical heroic look.</item>
        <item>The extrusion of the philtrum creates a groove that catches shade. You can break the top lip up to three areas.</item>
        <item>As the chin meets the bottom lip, there is a round fleshy area which curves around to create the wrinkle that extends from the nose.</item>
        <item>The ears have lots of hollows and extrusions. It takes a bit of practice to master.</item>
        <item>Fantastic, that is it. With the knowledge of the muscle structure, and the planes they, along with the skull and skin create, you should be able to master drawing the head.</item>

    <string-array name="b03t03Help">
        <item>We will start with the basic forms that we sketched from the level 2 tutorial.</item>
        <item>The pectoralis muscles connect to the bottom of the deltoids. It emerges from that one point across the body.</item>
        <item>The ab muscles, or rectus abdominis go from below the chest down to the crotch.</item>
        <item>The latissimus dorsi is the muscle which is runs around from the back and under the arm. The serratus anterior are the small muscles which connect them into the obliques.</item>
        <item>The external obliques run up from the ab muscles into the serratus anterior.</item>
        <item>The largest of the obliques goes around to the crotch area. This is largest area from the side of the torso.</item>
        <item>The deltoids are strongly linked to the chest muscles.</item>
        <item>The dominant neck muscles are the sternocleidomastoids which go from beneath the ear down towards the collarbone. </item>
        <item>The trapezius wraps around behind the neck forming connecting the shoulder to the back of the head.</item>
        <item>Great, now that we understand the muscles of the torso a bit better, let us take a look at how they create planes. </item>
        <item>The chest and ribcage area are the most dominant muscles. They create large flat planes that cut in to create shadows underneath them.</item>
        <item>The shoulders break into three sections from the deltoids. The middle one being the most dominant. </item>
        <item>The abs cut into each other to create areas for shadows. The deltoids from here up to the lats.</item>
        <item>From the underdrawing we can see how the rest of the muscles shape out the rest of the torso.</item>
        <item>The adams apple extrudes out from the neck, and between it and the sternocleidomastoid is an intruded plane.</item>
        <item>Fantastic, that is it. With the knowledge of the muscle structure, and the planes they, along with the bone and skin create, you should be able to master drawing the torso.</item>

        <item>The biceps are the dominant muscle and work in harmony with the triceps.</item>
        <item>The triceps wrap around the elbow and split into two parts.</item>
        <item>The brachioradialis go from alongside the biceps down to the wrist.</item>
        <item>The flexor carpi radialis and the rest of the arm muscles rotate around and down to the wrist.</item>
        <item>The flexor aponeurosis is almost like a wrist band wrapping around the lower part of the arm. </item>
        <item>Great, now that we understand the muscles of the arm a bit better, let us take a look at how they create planes.</item>
        <item>The more a person trains, the more defined their deltoids are. </item>
        <item>The biceps can be cut into three main planes, which like the deltoid, creates a sharp edge as it comes to its end.</item>
        <item>The triceps are extruded in a flat plane which curls around the back of the arm, the stronger the arm, the more the plane protrudes out.</item>
        <item>The lower arm muscles curve around the arms. They knit into each other defining their separate areas.</item>
        <item>Fantastic, that is it. With the knowledge of the muscle structure, and the planes they, along with the bone and skin create, you should be able to master drawing the arm.</item>

        <item>The fingers break into three individual parts. Look at the shape the fingertips can make, with the forward plane of each at an angle to make the tip the biggest part.</item>
        <item>Each break in the finger has a knuckle, but the forward one is not as noticeable.</item>

        <item>That is all the information we need for the feet.</item>
        <item>The main area of the foot is like a wedge. Note the flat area on the top and how the mass creates the arch underneath the foot.</item>
        <item>The back of the boot squashes down onto the ground.</item>
        <item>Treat the tips of the toes similarly to the tips of the fingers.</item>
